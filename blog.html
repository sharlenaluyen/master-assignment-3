<h2>First Assignment for CS 290</h2>
<p>I am very excited to begin learning about websites, design, and organization/user friendliness. For the first assignment, I struggled a little with git. With little experience of git, I naively jumped into this assignment without proper prepartion. However, I was able to quickly solve my problems with the helpful links Professor Hess provided in the assignment tasks. I found that even a quick Google search can help me solve my simple problems since I am not the first one to have these issues. On the other hand, I did find this assignment lacking in the creativity or innovative aspect. I really hope to learn more about design and how organization effects the user's ability to easily navigate through a website.</p>

<h2>Second Assignment for CS 290</h2>
<p>This assignment was not only time consuming but also a lot of guessing. I was able to explore a lot of CSS and Javascript. While digging through the given Google Doc and online resources, I learned the coding language. It was particularly frustrating doing things this way since everything seemed like a guessing game or a trial-and-error (but mostly error). 

The best thing I learned through this assignment is the entirety of the scope of CSS. I had no idea that CSS can accomplish so many visual elements. I also think I better understand the relationship, structure, and organization between JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. 

Additionally. I'm feeling less and less confident as we go through this class. With the struggle with assignment 1 to successfully schedule a demo, push correctly to GitHub, and publish to the website, I'm afraid I'm going to miss one of these steps one day.

Hopefully, over time, I will get the hang of it all! </p>
